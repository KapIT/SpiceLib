This is an unofficial fork of the Parsley framework written by Jens Halm (https://github.com/jenshalm) by Kap IT.
While we does not plan to actively maintains this framework, we still will provide a maven build, and few bugs fix
in the goal of releasing a 3.0.1 for our own purpose.
Feel free however to use this version when released.
Fill issue only in this project, and do not uses the issue tracker of the other parsley module repository.
